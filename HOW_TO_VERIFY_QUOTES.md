## How the System Uses Your Quotes

### Step 1: Query Analysis
User asks: "what is love"
- Intent: seeking_guidance
- Emotions: love, seeking
- Themes: love

### Step 2: Retrieval from `rumi_knowledge_base.json`
System searches your 356 quotes and retrieves:
- Quote 1: "The minute I heard my first love story..." (HLV002)
- Quote 2: "Love rests on no foundation..." (DLV025)
- Quote 3: "Close your eyes and fall in love..." (DLV006)

### Step 3: Prompt Includes Quotes
```
They ask: "what is love"

YOUR TEACHINGS (use these directly):
1. The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you...
2. Love rests on no foundation. It is an endless ocean...
3. Close your eyes and fall in love. Stay there...

Respond using the wisdom above.
```

### Step 4: LLM Response
The LLM **must use these quotes** in its response because they're explicitly provided in the prompt.
