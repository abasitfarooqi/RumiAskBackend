# Rumi Behavior Improvements

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### Problem 1: Incomplete Empathetic Detection
**Issue:** Messages like "i am feeling sorry" and ":(" were being classified as "Casual Chat" instead of "Empathetic Support".

**Root Cause:** The distress pattern detection in `conversation_layer.py` was missing several common emotional distress phrases and emoticons.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added "feeling sorry", "i'm sorry", "i feel sorry" to distress patterns
- Added sad/depressed indicators: "sad", "depressed", "down", "low", "hopeless"
- Added confusion patterns: "don't know", "dont know", "confused", "lost", "stuck"
- Added emoticon detection for ":(", ":'(", "😢", "😭", "😰", etc.
- Now checks both lowercase patterns AND original query for emoticons

### Problem 2: Responses Too Short
**Issue:** Responses were getting cut off or were too brief, especially in empathetic mode.

**Root Cause:** Token limits were too conservative.

**Fix Applied:**
- Increased `max_tokens_casual` from 220 to 240
- Increased `max_tokens_empathetic` from 280 to 320
- Updated `word_limit` for empathetic from [140,200] to [180,280]

### Problem 3: Low-Quality Prompt Templates
**Issue:** Prompt templates weren't generating engaging, complete responses.

**Fix Applied:**
- Improved empathetic prompt to include:
  - Clear PART 1 / PART 2 structure
  - Guidelines: "Be warm, genuine, and authentic"
  - Specific word counts: "180-280 words"
- Improved casual prompt to include:
  - Specific instruction for "5-7 complete sentences"
  - Action items: acknowledge, share, ask questions
  - Target: "80-180 words"

## 📊 Current Behavior

### Mode Detection Logic

#### Empathetic Support Triggers ❤️
Detection happens FIRST (before casual or wisdom modes). Triggers include:

**Physical/Emotional Pain:**
- "i'm in pain", "i feel pain", "i am in pain", "in pain", "hurts"
- "i'm hurt", "i feel hurt", "hurting", "suffering", "struggling"
- **NEW:** "feeling sorry", "i'm sorry", "i feel sorry"

**Sadness/Despair:**
- **NEW:** "feeling sad", "i'm sad", "i feel sad", "sad", "depressed", "down", "low"

**Fear/Anxiety:**
- "i'm scared", "i'm afraid", "scared", "worried", "anxious", "overwhelmed"

**Confusion/Uncertainty:**
- **NEW:** "don't know", "dont know", "i don't know", "dunno"
- **NEW:** "don't understand", "confused", "lost", "stuck"

**Help-Seeking:**
- "can't deal with", "can't handle", "too much", "help me"

**Emoticons:**
- **NEW:** ":(", ":'(", "😢", "😭", "😰", "😞", "😔", "😓"

#### Wisdom Mode Triggers 🔮
Deep/emotional indicators:
- "meaning", "purpose", "life", "love", "truth", "heart", "soul"
- "what is", "why", "where", "when", "who"
- Emotion patterns: "i feel", "i'm feeling", "i am feeling"

#### Casual Mode 💬
Simple greetings and introductions:
- "hi", "hello", "hey", "how are you", "what's up"
- "name", "who are you"
